# Energy-Made-Easy

This is Energy Made Easy.

This is a system of files designed to allow users to keep track of groups of solar panels 
and get an estimate of how much electricity they will make. 

To instal the system, install the files in this folder onto a public directory and
run the command:
				./eme_create_tabels.sh

This will create the Energy Made Easy database and tables on your server. 

These are the instructions to use Energy Made Easy:
1)	Click “Create New Account,” enter you credentials into the form, and click “Create Account.”
2)	Using the Username and Password you just made to log into your account.
3)	To continue with a project that already exists, select the radio button next to the desired project’s name, then click the “Edit selected project” button in the bottom right corner.
4)	To create a new project, select the “Create new project” radio button in the center box on your screen, then click the “Edit selected project” button in the bottom right corner.
5)	Change the name of the project in the text box in the top left corner of the screen. 
6)	In the center box on your screen, there are headings in a row that correspond to the text box below them. Enter the respective information into the text boxes.
7)	You MUST provide input for the Price, Count, Model Name, and Watts text boxes or else the system will not recognize that entry, and skip over it. It will not be saved in your project, nor will it be included on the Calculation Page.
8)	To add a new panel entry, click the button below the text boxes that says “Click to add another panel entry.” 
9)	To remove a panel entry, click the trashcan icon all the way to the right of the row of text boxes you want to delete.
10)	Once you have all the panels’ information, click the “Calculate” button in the lower right corner. This will bring you to the Calculation page. This is where the information of all the panels in your project will be displayed in a summary fashion as well as the amount of electricity each entry of solar panels will generate. There will also be a grand total at the bottom of the box in the middle of your screen. 
11)	If you want to go back and edit the project, use the back-arrow button in your web browser to go back to the project editing page. Note: you will only see the number of entries you started with at first. Refresh the page before you edit any information in the text boxes.
12)	Once you are satisfied with the end result of the summery on the Calculation page, click the “Print this page” button in the top right corner to save everything you see on screen as a PHF file. Once the PDF file is saved on your system, you can print it out or send it in an email. 
13)	To work on a different project, click the back-arrow button in your web browser until you get back to the Account page. Note: before doing this, you MUST click the “Calculate” button on the Project Editing page after making any changes you wish to keep.
14)	To exit the system, you can close the window of the web-app, as long as you are happy with the changes you have made AND you have clicked the “Calculate” button after finished editing a project.
